			<p>
				The above discussions of privacy, encryption, freedom of expression, intellectual property, and criminal behavior tended to treat the Internet as an American phenomenon.  The reality is that the Internet is a global network.  In fact, because the Internet allows people from all over the world to come together and share their common interests, it is doing much to bring about the so-called “global village”. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Certainly the global village is a good thing.  If for no other reason, it decreases the likelihood of war by increasing cross-cultural understanding.  When the citizens of the nations of the world chat daily over the Internet, the government of one nation will probably find it difficult to convince their populace that the people of another nation are their enemies.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The global village aspects of the Internet also introduce a number of problems.  In some countries political debate is encouraged, in others it is discouraged.  Some cultures are strictly monotheistic and frown strongly on open discussion of religious options.  Views on sex, nudity, and the portrayal of violence in the media also vary from culture to culture.  As a result, the laws governing these and many other topics vary widely from country to country.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The distributed nature of the Internet raises a number of vexing legal questions.  When information is stored on servers that exist in numerous countries located throughout the world, and that information is routinely transferred from continent to continent, whose laws should apply?  The laws that are in effect where the servers are located?  The laws that are in effect at each user’s location?  The laws that are in effect where the nodes and fiber optic cables (through which the data are transferred) are located?  Or do the laws at all of these locations apply?  If so, will the contents of the Internet be sanitized to such a degree that no individual, group, or country could possibly find them objectionable? 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These questions are very thorny.  As we have seen, even when the question of applicable law is limited to a single country, such as the United States, the answers are still unclear. How then can we hope to settle these issues on an international level?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before mass communication and the rise of the Internet, cultural differences could more or less be reflected in regional laws.  This was because people with similar beliefs tended to live physically near one another.  As can be seen in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals Child Online Protection Act ruling, people are beginning to question whether laws based on geographic location make sense for the Internet, especially those that are aimed at enforcing community standards.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some individuals go so far as to argue that laws should be crafted that would be based on the standards of virtual online communities.  Under such a system, it might be illegal, for example, to post an erotic image to a family-oriented discussion group which serves one community, but perfectly acceptable to post the same image to an adult-oriented group which serves another community.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Given that the question of whose laws should apply to the Internet is far from settled on the national level, it is clear that it will take years, if not decades, to unravel this legal knot on the international level.  In the opinion of this author, however, the gains to be derived from a vibrant global Internet far outweigh the problems that will inevitably arise due to its construction.
