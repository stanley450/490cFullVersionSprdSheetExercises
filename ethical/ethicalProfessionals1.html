				In June of 1996 an unmanned Ariane 5 rocket blew up approximately 30 seconds after launch.  The launch of this rocket, the first of its kind, was supposed to serve as a demonstration of the capabilities and reliability of the new Ariane 5 series.  It was to be the culmination of a 10 year $8 billion dollar development effort on the part of the European Space Agency – ushering in an era of world dominance in the satellite launch industry.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Instead, this disaster cost the European space program at least a billion dollars and well over a year in redesigns and additional tests.  Software in the guidance control computer was discovered to be at fault.  Instead of keeping the rocket on course, the system suffered a complete loss of guidance and attitude information 30 seconds after lift off – causing the launcher to tilt sharply and tear itself apart.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In August of 1997 a Boeing 747 aircraft crashed in bad weather over mountainous terrain in Guam.  A factor contributing to the crash was discovered to be a software bug in the airport’s Radar Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System.  The bug, which ironically was introduced during an upgrade of the system, reduced the area scanned from a fifty-five nautical mile radius around the airport to a narrow one-mile wide strip along the circumference of the area to be scanned.  If this backup system had been functioning properly, officials believe it likely that the plane would not have crashed and the lives of 226 people could have been saved. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One of the worst cases of software failure leading to the loss of human life occurred between June 1985 and January 1987 when at least six people suffered massive radiation overdoses from Therac-25 radiation therapy machines.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn10" id="body_ftn10">[10]</a></span>  Each of the exposed individuals suffered severe radiation burns.  Three patients died as a result of these overdoses.  The others sustained serious injuries.  All lawsuits arising from the incidents were settled out of court.  An official investigation into the accidents was never performed.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Creating reliable software is very difficult.  As alluded to in <span class="contentNum science"></span>, and discussed in detail in <span class="contentNum limits"></span>, it is impossible to prove that any non-trivial program is bug free.  Complicating this fact is the reality that most software is produced by large teams of programmers working long hours under tight schedules.  The best that can be done is to create software using modern development tools and techniques, and to rigorously test that software during production in order to discover and correct as many bugs as possible.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				How does one ensure that software designers exercise due caution when writing programs, that they take all reasonable measures to produce software that is as reliable and error free as possible?  And what happens when things go wrong – as they inevitably will in some cases?  Should people be able to sue for damages?  If so, who should be held responsible?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These questions are related to the concepts of accountability and liability.  Accountability is concerned with determining who is responsible for an action being taken or an event occurring.  Some aspects of accountability are related to management, other aspects to ethics.  Liability, on the other hand, is a legal question – it concerns who pays when things go wrong, and what limits, if any, should apply to the amounts that can be claimed for damages as the result of an accident or software failure.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The position taken in most software warranty statements is that the liability of the producer of the software is limited to the price paid for the software.  Most software companies claim they will not be held liable for any incidental damages that may occur due to use of their programs, even if the damages directly result from known bugs in the program.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For example, say you just spent the last nine months writing a book and as you type the last page of the 500-page manuscript, a bug in the word processor causes your document and all of its backups to be deleted.  The position of most software producers, under such an admittedly unlikely situation, is that they will not be held liable for your loss of data – even if it were to turn out that a disgruntled employee had purposefully inserted code to delete all document files when the user typed the words “the end”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Of course, just because software companies say they refuse to be liable for damages beyond the cost of the program, does not mean that the courts will agree with them.  So far, the question of liability remains pretty much an unsettled issue.  There have been few high profile court cases for civil restitution or criminal negligence against software producers.  In fact, most consumers appear to have accepted the notion that applications will occasionally fail, in the process causing them to lose some minutes (or hours) worth of work.  However, as our dependence on life-critical software systems steadily increases, it is probably just a matter of time before the issue of software liability comes to a head.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Let’s consider what might happen if one of the newer fly-by-wire aircraft, which are heavily dependent on embedded computer systems for their safe operation, were to crash – killing all on board.  Further, assume that the accident investigators are able to trace the fault back to a single line of code written by a programmer who worked for one of the aircraft manufacturer’s subcontractors.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn11" id="body_ftn11">[11]</a></span>			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Who should be liable in such a situation?  The airline that bought the plane?  The aircraft manufacturer who built the plane?  The subcontractor who developed the faulty computer program?  The programmer who wrote the line of code that contained the fatal bug?  Depending on the circumstances surrounding the accident, arguments can be made against any and all of these parties.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Most engineers believe that fly-by-wire aircraft, which depend on computer-based electronic systems, are at least as safe as (and probably much safer than) older aircraft designs that depend on electromechanical systems.  However, one could argue that such planes are inherently unsafe, since any trained computer scientist could tell you that the software they depend on can never be proven to be 100% bug free.  According to this argument, since such knowledge is widely known among computing professionals, surely an airline exercising due caution should have avoided purchasing such a plane.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A similar argument can be made against the airplane manufacturer.  While the component that failed was built by a subcontractor in our example, the manufacturer of the plane is still ultimately responsible for the performance of its product.  Since software is so notoriously unreliable, shouldn’t the manufacturer have avoided designing planes that depend so heavily on it?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What about the subcontractor that wrote the program containing the bug?  Did they not deliver a faulty product to the airplane manufacturer?  Shouldn’t they have to pay some sort of damages?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				And what of the programmer?  The man or woman who actually wrote the line of code that eventually caused the plane full of people to die.  Is he or she not ultimately responsible and therefore liable?  Many would argue yes.  However, it is impossible for human beings to write perfect code.  That is why code must be tested, retested, and tested again.  If the company’s testing program failed to catch the bug, can the programmer really be held responsible for this tragedy?  Even if there is every indication that the programmer was in no way negligent?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What if the opposite was the case – the programmer was grossly negligent, an alcoholic crack addict going through a messy divorce who hadn’t had a sober day in six months – at the very least the programmer should be “disbarred” from computing, right?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The unfortunate truth, that most people outside of computing would be shocked to learn, is that computing professionals are <span class="Ital">not</span> licensed.  This is in stark contrast to most other professions.  Doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers – all have professional licensing agencies.  To be granted a license to practice, an individual must demonstrate minimum levels of competence.  Such agencies typically retain the power to revoke the licenses of disreputable or incompetent individuals – thereby stripping them of their ability to earn an income.  This ability can serve as a powerful check against abuses of professional status.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You might be wondering why computing professionals are an exception.  Why are they not licensed?  The reason is that the profession is so new and its practitioners so diverse that no one is yet sure what constitutes minimum standards of professional competence.  In the opinion of this author, students studying to become computing professionals should mentally prepare themselves for the idea of professional licensing.  While it may take the occurrence of a high profile disaster such as the hypothetical one described above, licensing is probably just a matter of time.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before leaving this topic, I would like for you to consider the idea that lack of liability law is actually holding back computing progress in many areas, such as telemedicine and expert systems.  Tele-medicine involves using computers and communication systems to allow doctors at one location to examine and treat patients at another location.  At its simplest this can be a video conference call where the physician can visually inspect the patient and offer advice.  At the other extreme it can involve surgeons remotely operating on a patient using VR goggles and data gloves to control a “surgical robot”.  The fact that no one is quite sure which laws apply to doctors, patients, equipment manufactures, and software producers under such situations has a chilling effect on bringing innovations to market.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To give a simple example, doctors are licensed on a state-by-state basis.  If a doctor is located in Maine (where she is licensed) but her patient is in West Virginia, is she practicing without a license?  In the area of telemedicine, is it reasonable to expect doctors to obtain separate licenses for each state in which their patients reside?  Or is placing a video telemedicine call to a doctor in Maine similar to getting on a plane and actually traveling to the doctor’s location? 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Medical expert systems provide a final example.  <span class="Bolded">Expert systems</span> are computer programs that function at or near the level of a human expert in a narrow problem domain such as infection diagnosis.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn12" id="body_ftn12">[12]</a></span>  While today’s programs are a far cry from the fictional Emergency Medical Holographic Doctor on “Star Trek: Voyager”, some can provide excellent advice on limited aspects of medicine.  However, without means of legal recourse for bad advice their application is extremely limited.  After all, if you knew that no one was legally liable in cases of incorrect diagnosis and ineffectual (or harmful) treatment plans, would you use such a program?  How could you trust its advice?  Furthermore, what company would devote the resources necessary to developing and marketing such a beast?
