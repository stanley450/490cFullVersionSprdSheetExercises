Notes
=====

For Mike:
---------
- can create new things?
- ease of modification
  - either a tool for mike, or not
  - separation of data and logic

### TODO
- i think the relationship name needs to be in the statement.
  - would be simple enough to add a "name" field in each action
  - just pass it to the accept bit, tada
- need a fixed-width font for the statements (maybe?)
- need to add quotes around text entries
  - do we also need them around tables? we'll check into that.
- want to look into performance issues, but that will come last.
- the whole 'get smaller with the screen' thing
- modularization
  - separating data and logic
  - being able to do multiple labs w/o copying everything

---

- i'm betting we can take the 'remove' function out of the hist object array
  and put a single one in the $scope. we'd just need some way to get that index
  into it.

----------
- final notes
- there's a nice walkthrough version now.
  - need to work on ease of modification
  - that separation of data and logic thing again.
- *`project` needs to be changed*
  - the output order doesn't depend on the order of the statement

#### List of tools:
- git
- angular.js
- twitter bootstrap
- node.js

- require.js
- less css
- bower

---

- considering doing a loading screen
- figure and editor pull from the same code
  - we accomplish this by pointing both indexes to a common main, which pull in
    differing DatabaseApp.
  - so how do we pull off different figures?
  - the only difference (fairly certain) is the statements.
    - (feel like we worked pretty hard for that to be so)
  - feel like we're going to have different (mostly identical) mains (rename
    config) for each index

---

# **PROBLEM**
- so my figures were all each in their own directory. it meant that WAIT THAT
  MIGHT WORK okay
- all teh figures were their own directories
- therefore, pointing at a config was easy: it was always the same place
- we can't point to the same relative pathname now, because we're all in the
  same directory
- ergo, they would all point to the same file
- however, doesn't matter, because none of the base html files are the same
  now anyways
- we just point each base file to its own `main.js`, which sets up everything...
- okay, we need to defrag real quick. what does the whole thing look like?

---

- we have `lib/`, `common/`, `js/` ... we don't need common anymore.
- we have `lib/`, `js/`, `css/`, and our slew of html siblings
- in `js/`, we have a set of mirroring `config.js` (adapted from `main.js` and
  multiple `statements.js`)
- each base html will have a number of magic divs, and a script-link to it's
  mirroring config
- the config will
  - set up the datastructures (`statements`, `div_ids`, and `fig_ids`)
  - read in each fragment html section...
  - we need to uniqely identify each `fragment` pulled in
  - jquery: when ajaxing in the piece, html manipulation and stick on an id?
  - pop the statements into placepull in the `DatabaseApp`
  - (which will be converted to accept parameters?).
- *We don't know what having multiple figures on the same page will look like*

### Putting multiple figures on the same page
- (will be using magic divs)
- what comes to mind is using multiple controllers.
- got it:
  - when loading in items, tack on top-level attribute `ng-init` -> `init(div_id)`
  - set up some service that has all the data in it as a mapping
  - each controller instance looks up its div and grabs that statement list

### working on getting the figure -> editor and editor -> figure exporting working

- going from figure to editor
  - in figure, we grab our statement datastruct and store it in sessionStorage
    - using JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
  - in editor, for each statement
    - create new action objects, populate them, and run them
- going from editor to figure
  - in editor, when populating history for each relation created, we create a
    `summary` object that represents a statement
  - simply collect these `summary` objects, and store them in sessionStorage
- in figure -> editor we store the page and figure, so that we can navigate
  back from the editor

### autosave design stuffs
- we need some way to manually clear it.
- half-baked attempts at guessing what the user wants are the devil
- when is it useful / when do we need it?

> **need to clear on deletion**
> done

---

- show figure relations by default
- be able to show tables w/o statement (student relation figure, etc.)
- go ahead and do exercises

---

### 2014-05-05
- working on refining the way we pull in data, base on a combination of whether
  or not we are a figure and/or importing.
